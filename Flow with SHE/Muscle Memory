**Flow with SHE**

*Muscle Memory*

Muscle memory can be one of those things that we don't really think about on a daily basis, but we use every day. Take walking for example. We rely heavily on muscle memory to do this; it's something we practiced so much as a child that we no longer put any conscious thought into. We just walk, and the majority on the time it works out well (except for the occasional mistep).

According to Malcolm Gladwell, it can take up to 10,000 hours of repetition to gain the unconscious memory, or muscle memory, needed to master a skill. However, you can begin to reep the benefits of repetitive and consistent training in as little as a few weeks.

**How can muscle memory help us become better athletes?** The more unconscious memory we have the less we have to think and the more we can simply do.This allows for the potential of entering a flow state. In a flow state effort falls away, we are able to be fully present in the moment, we can have amazing experienes and achieve miraculous feats.

**Is it possible to have muscle memory for unhealthy anatomical functions?** Yes! But the good news is that through a little awareness (last month's focus) you can "reprogram" your unconscious thought. It only takes a little bit of repetitive practice to form a new unconscious function, and that leads us to this month's focus- **practice**.

We will be doing the same yoga practice every friday for four weeks. As we move through the weeks take note of what shows up for you. Do you feel stronger? Do you get irritated? Does the practice get easier or more challenging? It's all just information that you can use to understand your own habits and blind spots.
