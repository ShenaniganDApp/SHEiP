## Simple Summary

<!--Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SHEiP.-->

A weekly yoga flow class with complimentary published content

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->

Each week we will provide a yoga flow class via zoom. To encourage participation, each class will be recorded so that people can take the class when it best suites their schedule. We will have content published in SHE's substack that will correspond to the themes we are exploring each quarter and month, and that coincide with the practice we do in the class. This a great way to distribute the token throughout the community, and to distinguish which community members are active.

## Motivation

<!--Motivation is critical for SHEiPs that want to change SHE. It should clearly explain why SHE is inadequate in its current state and then address the problem that the SHEiP solves. SHEiP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

We want to get our community moving, connected to their bodies, and do something that is mindful and compliments their current practices. This will also help the DAO align with its values, and provide an event that will allow the DAO to grow in its mission.

## Specification

<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.-->

### Minimum Viable Contributions

- 60 minute live yoga class via zoom
- Recording of the live session
- attendance will be taken and documented

### Bonus Contributions

- Articles related to the themes and what we are focusing on in the yoga class
- Athlete specific focused meetings

The yoga classes will be added to the [Flow with SHE Repo](https://github.com/rlholmes38/Flow-with-SHE) where I will be submitting the weekly contributions to be reviewed. If this proposal passes, this repo will be forked and merged into the SHE github organization where it will added to the sourcecred graph.

Cred Allotment

- Instructor MVC rate (minimum viable contribution)
  16 cred
- Participant Rate via an initiative
  1 cred

In addition to the contribution cred, bonus cred will be allotted per live person at a rate of .2 cred.

## Rationale

<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is works in other environments. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

We decided to format the class this way for three reasons.

- Providing a recorded class provides more people the ability to take the class, and feel a part of the community.
- Having written content helps connect the right and left brain. The content will help people understand intellectually, while the exploring the movement we understand it in our bodies.
- Token incentives will introduce new people to the DAO through movement while also getting new people to do yoga.

## Backwards Compatibility

<!--All SHEiPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The SHEiP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. SHEiP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility section may be rejected outright.-->

There are no backwards compatibilities.

## Implementation

<!--The implementations must be completed before any SHEiP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the SHEiP is accepted.-->

- Taking time to plan and implement a yoga class each week: about two hours.
- Creating quarterly themes, and content around those themes for deeper understanding.
- Make myself available for any athlete specific meetings as they come.

## Security Considerations

<!--All SHEiPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. SHEiP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An SHEiP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
