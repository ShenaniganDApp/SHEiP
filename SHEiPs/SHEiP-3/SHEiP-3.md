Simple Summary
Community vote on the style of PANTS to be fabricated for our Pants.energy NFT.

Abstract
We are at the final stage of our sprint to release our first edition of NFT-backed activewear. There are two design prototypes to choose from. We are conducting a community vote via this SHEiP. This is purely a personal preference based on what you would like to wear. Pick which one you would like best by commenting below.

Motivation
Our goal is to bring PANTS to the Shenanigan community and provide a system of governance in regards to which design style our users prefer as a collective.

Specification
Made with a 95% polyester and 5% spandex blend. Each panel is individually printed, cut, and sewn to ensure a flawless graphic with no imperfections. Sizes range from extra small to four extra-large (XS-4XL).

Delivery time is 4-6 weeks, with rush delivery available for an additional $8/pair.

Rationale
Give the community a voice in this milestone decision.
Utilize the SHEiP protocol to aggregate consensus and execute decision.
Implementation
✅ Stage 1: Developed front end at Pants.energy. Airdropped PANTS tokens to all prior SHWEATPANTS holders. Stood up liquidity from DAO treasury to match SHWEATPANTS token value as of May 26 snapshot.

✅ Stage 2: Merged PANTS token and logo with Honeyswap official token list.

✅ Stage 3: Team collaborated with our designer/distributor to develop two PANTS designs.

✅ Stage 4: Designer fabricated and delivered two working PANTS prototypes (one of each design).

➡ Stage 5: Community vote between PANTS designs.
